# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

## Getting Started

1. Head to git@github.com:NateBainer/tweeter.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device using ssh (the ssh is also git@github.com:NateBainer/tweeter.git).
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

## How to Use Tweeter

- Create a Tweet that's under 140 characters and click the TWEET button. You will see it appear on screen. The tweet will appear as though it was tweeted by a random person. This person is randomly generated, so don't be afraid that someone out there is watching you type into your computer.
